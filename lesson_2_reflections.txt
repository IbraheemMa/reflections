How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


*********************************************************************
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

using command "git diff" to check the differince between the "working directory" and "staging area"
on the other hand to check the diffrence between the "staging area" and the "repository" we can use the command "git diff --staged"
to remove the editet file that we don't want to add it to the stage area we must use the command "git reset --hard" but we must be very careful when
we use this command because it's delete all the changed for the none staged files.
